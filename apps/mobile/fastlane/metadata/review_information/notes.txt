This app is a mobile remote client for Claude Code and Codex CLI tools.

To use the app, a self-hosted Bridge Server must be running on the user's development machine. The app connects to this server via WebSocket.

The app does not directly access Anthropic or OpenAI APIs. It communicates only with the user's own Bridge Server.

For review purposes: the app will show a connection screen on launch. Without a Bridge Server, the app's functionality is limited to the connection and settings screens.
