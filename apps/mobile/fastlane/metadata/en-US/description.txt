ccpocket is a mobile remote for Claude Code and Codex — the AI coding agents that write, edit, and manage code for you.

This app is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with Anthropic or OpenAI.

START SESSIONS FROM YOUR PHONE
Launch new coding sessions directly from your phone — no need to open a laptop first. Pick a project, set a permission mode, and start coding in seconds.

BATCH APPROVAL AT A GLANCE
Multiple agents running? See all pending approvals across sessions in one list. Review and approve file edits, command executions, and tool calls without switching context.

MOBILE-OPTIMIZED UI
Built for touch. Answer agent questions, approve tools, and provide feedback through a UI designed for mobile — not a shrunken desktop experience.

RICH PROMPTS
Write with Markdown formatting and auto-completing bullet lists. Attach images from your clipboard or photo gallery to give visual context to your agent.

ORGANIZE YOUR SESSIONS
Name your sessions and browse by project. Find past conversations instantly with search and project-based filtering.

REVIEW DIFFS
See every code change at once with syntax-highlighted diffs. Review file statistics, select specific change blocks, and send feedback.

REAL-TIME STREAMING
Watch your agent think and code live. View inline diffs, thinking blocks, and structured plans as they stream in.

PUSH NOTIFICATIONS
Get notified instantly when your agent needs approval or completes a task. Never miss a permission request again.

FLEXIBLE CONNECTIONS
Connect to your self-hosted Bridge Server via saved machines, QR code, mDNS auto-discovery, or manual URL. Optionally manage remote servers over SSH.

PRIVACY FIRST
Your code and conversations stay on your own server. No telemetry, no tracking. ccpocket collects no personal data.

HOW IT WORKS
1. Install the Bridge Server: npx @ccpocket/bridge@latest
2. Scan the QR code or enter the URL in the app
3. Start coding from your phone

That's it — you're ready to go in under 5 minutes.

REQUIREMENTS
- A Mac or Linux machine with Claude Code or Codex CLI installed
- Network connectivity between your phone and the server (local network or Tailscale recommended)
