ccpocket is a mobile remote for Claude Code and Codex — the AI coding agents that write, edit, and manage code for you.

This app is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with Anthropic or OpenAI.

CONTROL YOUR AGENTS FROM ANYWHERE
Approve file edits, command executions, and tool calls right from your phone. No need to stay at your desk — manage your coding sessions on the go.

REAL-TIME STREAMING CHAT
Watch your agent think and code in real-time with streaming responses. View inline diffs, thinking blocks, and structured plans as they happen.

MULTI-SESSION MANAGEMENT
Run and switch between multiple sessions. Resume previous conversations, search session history, and filter by project.

ADVANCED DIFF VIEWER
Review code changes with syntax-highlighted diffs. Select specific change blocks, view file statistics, and send feedback to your agent.

FLEXIBLE CONNECTIONS
Connect to your self-hosted Bridge Server via saved machines, QR code, mDNS auto-discovery, or manual URL. Optionally manage remote servers over SSH.

PUSH NOTIFICATIONS
Get notified instantly when your agent needs approval or completes a task. Never miss a permission request again.

PRIVACY FIRST
Your code and conversations stay on your own server. No telemetry, no tracking. ccpocket collects no personal data.

HOW IT WORKS
1. Install the Bridge Server on your Mac: npm install -g ccpocket-bridge
2. Start it: ccpocket-bridge
3. Open ccpocket on your phone and connect via QR code, auto-discovery, or URL

That's it — you're ready to go in under 5 minutes.

REQUIREMENTS
- A Mac or Linux machine with Claude Code or Codex CLI installed
- Network connectivity between your phone and the server (local network or Tailscale recommended)
